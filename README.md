SCT_DS_TASK-3

SCT_DS_TASK-3 — Bank Marketing Analysis & Decision Tree Classification
This project was completed as Task 03 during my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The task focuses on applying a machine learning classification model (Decision Tree) to predict customer responses based on bank marketing data.

📌 Project Objective
To analyze bank marketing data and build a Decision Tree model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Google Colab

 Data Preparation Steps
Loaded the dataset using appropriate separators
Examined dataset structure and data types
Checked target variable distribution
Encoded categorical features into numerical form
Split data into training and testing sets

 Model Building
Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier
Trained the model using training data
Generated predictions on test data
Visualized the decision tree for interpretability

 Model Evaluation
The following evaluation techniques were used:
Accuracy score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

 Key Insights
The dataset showed class imbalance between subscribed and non-subscribed customers
Call duration played a major role in prediction
Decision Tree helped understand decision rules clearly
The model achieved good overall accuracy while highlighting challenges in predicting minority class

 Output
Trained Decision Tree model
Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix
Decision Tree visualization for feature-based decisions

 Skills Gained
Supervised machine learning
Decision Tree algorithm understanding
Data encoding techniques
Model evaluation and interpretation
Working with real-world business datasets
