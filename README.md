# SCT_DS_TASK-3
# Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
To build a Decision Tree model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service using demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Methodology
- Loaded semicolon-separated dataset
- Performed one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Results
- Accuracy: ~88%
- The most important feature was call duration
- The model performed well despite class imbalance

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree model effectively predicts customer subscription behavior and provides clear interpretability of decision rules.
